2. stop the streamlit application (stop with: "control + c" and restart with "arrow up + enter")
3. start the streamlit application ("arrow up + enter" or the command "streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.enableCORS false --server.enableXsrfProtection false")
4. wait until the application is loaded
